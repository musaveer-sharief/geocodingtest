1. Assuming phpunit is already installed in the system using composer
2. Run in command prompt, go to the particular folder and run the below command that does 10 assertions
phpunit mapsTest.php


My Thoughts/ Suggestions while implementing this requirement
1. Added all the types of maps class in a folder, if new api comes we can add new line in INI file and create required new class alone. (Open closed Principle)
2. Used the interface of maptype instead of api class. (Dependency Inversion Principle)
3. Jquery simple plugin created so that it can be used any place, easily removable, Expandable based on new requirements
4. Since it is public functionality, not used REST API, only simple ajax algorithm used to wrap it within 6 hours.
5. Factory design pattern mostly used.
